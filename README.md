This repository contains the Stata code to replicate the results of Cascino, Szeles, and Veenman (2025) "Does CEO Inside Debt Really Improve Financial Reporting Quality?" The main paper presents a *reexamination* of the relation between inside debt and measures of financial reporting quality using research design choices independent from prior research, while the Online Appendix presents *replications* of two prior studies that documented a significant negative association between inside debt variables and inverse measures of financial reporting quality.

The repository contains the following do-files:
